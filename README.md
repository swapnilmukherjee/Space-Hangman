# Space Hangman 🌌

Welcome to Space Hangman - a galactic twist on the classic game of Hangman! Dive into the universe and test your knowledge of space-themed words.

## Overview 📖

Space Hangman is a web-based game created using Flask where players attempt to guess a space-themed word, letter by letter. Players get a limited number of attempts, and with each incorrect guess, a part of a spaceship gets damaged. Guess the word correctly to save the spaceship from destruction!

## Features 🚀

- **Galactic Word Pool**: Guess from a wide variety of space-themed words, from 'astronomy' to 'wormhole'.
- **Hints**: Stuck on a word? Use the hint feature to get a definition of the word you're trying to guess.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: The game keeps track of your guesses, showing your progress and the number of attempts left.
- **Immersive Experience**: With a space-themed background video and ambient music, players will truly feel they are in the vastness of space.

## How to Play 🎮

1. Open the game, and you'll be presented with blank spaces representing the letters of the word you need to guess.
2. Guess a letter by entering it into the input box.
3. If the letter is in the word, it will appear in the correct spaces. If not, your number of attempts will decrease.
4. Use the "Hint" button if you're stuck and need some help.
5. Keep guessing until you either guess the entire word or run out of attempts.
6. You need to click "Play Again" to start the game. We are currently working on the bug.
